A messaging website made my the Tyrell group

## Description
This is a messaging website committed to multiple users being able to type, edit, and delete your own messages. You should be able to give a thumbs up or down for a message(s), clear them, and choose a user.
You should be able to change the theme to light or dark mode also. And, choose a large mode for the visually impaired.
